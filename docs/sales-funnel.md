# Sales Funnel Research 
Awareness — Attract Attention

At the awareness stage, the goal is to make potential customers notice the brand or product. Websites use eye-catching visuals, strong headlines, and SEO-optimized content to attract visitors. For example, homepage banners, social media ads, and blog posts introduce the brand’s message and values. This stage focuses on grabbing attention and making a strong first impression.

Interest — Build Curiosity

Once users are aware, the website aims to keep them interested. This is done through informative content, videos, product descriptions, and interactive features that explain what makes the brand unique. A clear navigation bar, engaging visuals, and sections like “How it Works” or “Our Story” help users explore further and learn more about the products or services offered.

Desire — Create Emotional Connection

At the desire stage, websites strengthen emotional appeal. Brands use testimonials, lifestyle imagery, persuasive copy, and storytelling to make users imagine themselves benefiting from the product. Highlighting exclusivity, social proof, and customer success stories helps transform interest into genuine desire to buy or join.

Action — Encourage Conversion

Finally, the action stage motivates the user to take the next step—such as making a purchase, signing up, or requesting more info. Websites use clear calls-to-action (CTAs) like “Buy Now,” “Start Free Trial,” or “Join Today.” Simple checkout processes, trust badges, and limited-time offers further reduce hesitation and lead to conversion.
